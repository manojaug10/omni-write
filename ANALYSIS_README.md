## Questions & Clarifications

### Q: Why is Phase 1 only 40% complete?
A: The basic Clerk integration and login UI are done, but the main dashboard pages, protected routes, and application structure are missing. Phase 1 requires more than just authenticationâ€”it requires the core application UI shell.

### Q: What should I work on next?
A: Complete Phase 1 by building the dashboard page, protected routes, and navigation. Once Phase 1 is fully done, move to Phase 2 (Social Media OAuth).

### Q: Can we deploy to production now?
A: No. The application is not feature-complete and hasn't been tested. Phase 0 foundation is solid, but Phase 1 (the main app) is incomplete. Deployment should wait until at least Phase 1 is 100% done.

### Q: Should we add TypeScript?
A: The current JavaScript setup works fine. TypeScript can be added in Phase 8 (Polish & Testing) if desired, but it's not critical for MVP launch.

### Q: Is the database schema complete?
A: The User model is implemented. All other models (Post, SocialAccount, Analytics, etc.) are designed in the roadmap but not yet created in schema.prisma. They'll be added in upcoming phases.
