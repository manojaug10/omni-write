## Database Schema Analysis

**Current Schema (schema.prisma):**

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  clerkId   String   @unique
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

**Status:** Only User model implemented, deployed to Supabase

**Schema Defined But Not Implemented:**
- SocialAccount (for OAuth connections)
- Post (for content storage)
- PostSocialAccount (junction table)
- Hashtag (for hashtag management)
- Analytics (for metrics)
- UserWritingProfile (for AI training data)

**Gap:** Database schema is well-designed in the progress tracker but only User model exists in actual schema.prisma

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Sprint - Phase 1 Completion)
1. **Complete Dashboard Layout**
   - Create Dashboard.jsx page component
   - Add sidebar navigation
   - Implement protected route wrapper

2. **Add Protected Routes**
   - Create middleware for Clerk JWT verification
   - Wrap dashboard and other authenticated pages
   - Handle unauthorized access

3. **User Profile Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user
   - `PATCH /api/users/me` - Update profile
   - `DELETE /api/users/me` - Delete account

4. **Test Clerk Integration**
   - Deploy webhook to Railway
   - Add CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET to Railway env vars
   - Test real user signup flow
   - Verify user sync to database

### Short-term (Phase 2-3)
1. Implement Social Media OAuth (X, LinkedIn, Meta)
2. Create Post model and composer UI
3. Set up Rich Text Editor

### Medium-term (Phase 4-5)
1. Implement scheduling with Bull + Redis
2. Integrate Claude API for AI features

## Deployment Status

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- ✅ Configuration complete (vercel.json)
- ✅ SPA routing configured
- ✅ Asset caching headers configured
- ❌ Not yet deployed to production
- ❌ Env vars not set up

**Backend (Railway):**
- ✅ Configuration complete (railway.json, Procfile)
- ✅ Prisma generation configured
- ✅ Restart policy configured
- ❌ Not yet deployed to production
- ❌ Environment variables need setup:
  - DATABASE_URL
  - CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
  - REDIS_URL

---

## Conclusion

The Omni Write project is **well-founded with solid infrastructure** but is still in **early-stage development**. Phase 0 foundation work is excellent, with proper deployment pipelines and database setup. Phase 1 (Authentication) is approximately 40% complete with Clerk integration working at the backend webhook level but missing frontend pages and protected routes.

The project is ready to move forward on Phase 1 completion before starting Phase 2 (Social Media OAuth). The architecture is clean and scalable, but actual feature development on the core product hasn't begun yet.

**Estimated MVP completion:** 10-13 weeks at 15-20 hours/week development pace (aligned with original tracker estimate).
