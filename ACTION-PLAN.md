**What's Missing:** Webhook configuration in Clerk Dashboard ⏳  
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes ⏱️

---

## 🚀 3-STEP FIX (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Add Webhook in Clerk Dashboard (2 min)

1. **Open:** https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Login** and select your "Omni Write" application
3. **Click:** "Webhooks" in the left sidebar
4. **Click:** Blue "Add Endpoint" button (top right)
5. **Fill in the form:**
   
   **Endpoint URL:**
   ```
   https://omni-write-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/clerk
   ```
   
   **Description (optional):**
   ```
   Sync users to Supabase database
   ```
   
   **Subscribe to events:**
   - ☑️ Check `user.created`
   - ☑️ Check `user.updated`
   - ☑️ Check `user.deleted`

6. **Click:** "Create" button

**Expected Result:** You should see the webhook with a green "Active" status

---

### Step 2: Test with Real User (1 min)

**Option A: Create Test User in Clerk Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Still in Clerk Dashboard, click "Users" in sidebar
2. Click "Create User" button (top right)
3. Fill in:
   - **Email:** `webhooktest@example.com`
   - **First name:** `Webhook`
   - **Last name:** `Test`
   - **Password:** (any test password)
4. Click "Create"

**Option B: Test from Webhook Dashboard**

1. In Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Click on your newly created webhook
3. Click "Testing" tab
4. Find "user.created" event
5. Click "Send Example"

⚠️ **Note:** "Send Example" may have incomplete data. Real user creation is more reliable.

---

### Step 3: Verify User in Database (30 sec)

**Method 1: Supabase Table Editor (Easiest)**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project
3. Click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
4. Click "User" table
5. **Look for your test user!** 🎉

**Method 2: SQL Query**

1. In Supabase, click "SQL Editor"
2. Run this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     id,
     "clerkId",
     email,
     name,
     "createdAt"
   FROM "User"
   ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
3. Click "Run"
4. **You should see your test user!** 🎉

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

### In Clerk Dashboard (Webhooks page):
- ✅ Webhook status shows "Active" (green)
- ✅ "Message Attempts" tab shows successful deliveries
- ✅ Last delivery shows 200 OK response

### In Railway Logs:
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Open your backend service
3. Click "Deployments" → Latest → "View Logs"
4. Look for:
   ```
   📥 Webhook received - Headers: {...}
   ✅ Webhook signature verified
   📨 Webhook event: user.created for user user_xxxxx
   🔄 Creating user user_xxxxx...
   📝 User data: email=webhooktest@example.com, name=Webhook Test
   ✅ User created in database: clmt_xxxxx
   ✅ User created successfully: user_xxxxx
   ```

### In Supabase Database:
- ✅ User table has new row
- ✅ Email is `webhooktest@example.com`
- ✅ Name is `Webhook Test`
- ✅ clerkId starts with `user_`
- ✅ createdAt is recent timestamp

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't see Webhooks in Clerk Dashboard"
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Clerk account
- Verify you've selected the correct application
- Webhooks should be in the left sidebar under "Configure"

### "Webhook shows 400 or 500 error in Clerk"
**Check Railway Logs for details:**
1. Go to https://railway.app → Your backend → Deployments → View Logs
2. Look for error messages with ❌

**Common errors:**
- `Webhook secret not configured` → Add CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET to Railway
- `Invalid signature` → Check webhook secret matches
- `No email addresses provided` → Use real user instead of test data

### "User not appearing in database"
1. Check Railway logs - did webhook get received?
2. Check Clerk webhook delivery logs - was it sent?
3. Verify DATABASE_URL in Railway variables
4. Try creating another test user

### "Can't access Railway logs"
1. Make sure you're logged into Railway
2. Select the correct project/service
3. If deployment is very recent, wait 30 seconds and refresh
