# Simple Deployment Guide for Omni Write
## For Non-Programmers - Step by Step

---

## What Are We Doing?

Think of deployment like this:
- **Your code** is like a recipe written on paper
- **Deployment** is like opening a restaurant where people can actually eat the food
- We need to put your app online so people can use it from anywhere

We'll use two services:
1. **Vercel** - Hosts your website (the part people see and click)
2. **Railway** - Hosts your backend (the part that handles data and logic)

Both have **FREE plans** that work great for testing!

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ A GitHub account (you already have this)
- ‚úÖ Your code pushed to GitHub (we just did this)
- ‚úÖ 30 minutes of time
- ‚úÖ Access to your email (for verification codes)

# Part 1: Deploy Your Backend (Railway)

## Step 1: Create a Railway Account

1. **Go to** https://railway.app
2. **Click** the big **"Start a New Project"** button
3. **Click** "Login with GitHub"
4. **Allow Railway** to access your GitHub repositories
5. You'll see your Railway dashboard

## Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Repository

1. **Click** "New Project" (purple button)
2. **Click** "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Find and click** on `omni-write` (your repository)
4. Railway will show you the repository details

## Step 3: Configure the Backend

**IMPORTANT:** Railway needs to know which folder has your backend code.

1. Railway will show your repository
2. **BEFORE clicking Deploy**, look for **"Settings"** or a **gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è**
3. **Click** "Settings"
4. **Find** "Root Directory" or "Service Root"
5. **Type:** `backend` (exactly like this, lowercase)
6. **Click** "Save" or go back
7. **Now click** "Deploy" or it will deploy automatically

**Alternative if you don't see Settings:**
1. After deployment fails (like yours did), **click** on your service
2. **Click** "Settings" tab
3. **Scroll to** "Root Directory"
4. **Change it to:** `backend`
5. **Click** "Redeploy" at the top

## Step 4: Add Your Secret Keys (Environment Variables)

Think of these like passwords your app needs to work.

1. **Click** on your deployed service (you'll see it building)
2. **Click** the **"Variables"** tab at the top
3. **Click** "Add Variable" or "New Variable"

Now add these one by one:

### Variable 1: Database Connection
- **Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
- **Value:** `postgresql://postgres:D0%7B%60wq%3E2K4~mK%5E%3F~%3Ap%24W@db.jesvkdkkkbbxocvyaidn.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. **Click** the **"Deployments"** tab
2. You'll see a progress bar - this takes about 2-3 minutes
3. When you see a **green checkmark ‚úì**, it's live!

## Step 6: Get Your Backend URL

1. **Click** the **"Settings"** tab
2. **Scroll down** to "Domains"
3. **Click** "Generate Domain"
4. Railway will give you a URL like: `omni-write-backend.up.railway.app`
5. **COPY THIS URL** - you'll need it for the frontend!

## Step 7: Test Your Backend

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Go to:** `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/health`
   - Replace `YOUR-RAILWAY-URL` with the URL you copied
   - Example: `https://omni-write-backend.up.railway.app/api/health`
3. You should see: `{"status":"ok"}`
4. **If you see this, congratulations! Your backend is live! üéâ**

# What You Just Did

Let me explain what happened in simple terms:

## Railway (Backend) ‚úÖ
- Your backend code is now running on Railway's servers
- It's connected to your Supabase database
- It's ready to handle requests from your frontend
- It will automatically restart if something goes wrong
- **URL Example:** `https://omni-write-backend.up.railway.app`

## Vercel (Frontend) ‚úÖ
- Your React website is now hosted on Vercel's global network
- People anywhere in the world can access it fast
- It's connected to your Railway backend
- Every time you push code to GitHub, it auto-updates!
- **URL Example:** `https://omni-write.vercel.app`

## How They Work Together

```
Person visits your website
        ‚Üì
   Vercel serves the website
        ‚Üì
   User clicks a button
        ‚Üì
   Website sends request to Railway
        ‚Üì
   Railway processes the request
        ‚Üì
   Railway talks to Supabase database
        ‚Üì
   Railway sends back the data
        ‚Üì
   Website shows the result to user
```

# Common Issues & Solutions

## Problem: Backend shows "Application Error"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the failed deployment
5. Look at the logs - it will tell you what's wrong
6. Usually it's a missing environment variable

## Problem: Frontend can't connect to backend

**Solution:**
1. Check the `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel
2. Make sure it matches your Railway URL exactly
3. Make sure there's NO trailing slash (/)
4. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
5. Edit the `VITE_API_URL` if needed
6. Redeploy (Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click ‚ãØ ‚Üí Redeploy)

## Problem: Railway says "could not determine how to build the app"

**This is the error you're seeing!**

**Solution:**
1. **Go to** Railway dashboard
2. **Click** on your failed deployment/service
3. **Click** "Settings" tab (on the left or top)
4. **Scroll down** to find "Root Directory" or "Service Root"
5. **Type:** `backend` (must be exactly this, lowercase)
6. **Click** "Update" or "Save"
7. **Go back** to the main page
8. **Click** the three dots ‚ãØ (or "Deploy" button)
9. **Click** "Redeploy"
10. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - it should work now!

**Why this happens:**
- Railway was looking at your whole project (root folder)
- Your backend code is in the `backend` folder
- We need to tell Railway: "Hey, look in the backend folder!"

## Problem: "Cannot read environment variable"

**Solution:**
- Go to the platform (Railway or Vercel)
- Click Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Double-check all variables are spelled correctly
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Click "Redeploy"

## Problem: Build failed on Vercel

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Click "View Build Logs"
4. Look for red error messages
5. Usually it's:
   - Wrong root directory (should be `frontend`)
   - Missing environment variable
   - Typo in variable name

# How to Update Your Website After Making Changes

## Every time you make changes to code:

1. **Save your files** in VS Code
2. **Open terminal** and run:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
4. **Both Railway and Vercel will automatically deploy your changes!**
5. **Refresh your website** to see the updates

You don't need to do anything else - it's all automatic! üéâ
