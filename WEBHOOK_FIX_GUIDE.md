# Webhook Fix Guide - Database Sync Issue

## Status: WEBHOOK ENDPOINT IS WORKING ‚úÖ

The webhook endpoint at `https://omni-write-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/clerk` is **live and working correctly**.

**Verification:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://omni-write-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/clerk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
# Response: {"error":"Missing svix headers"} (Status: 400)
```

This is the **correct response** - it means the webhook route is registered and waiting for Clerk to send properly signed requests.

---

## The Real Issue

The webhook endpoint is working, but users aren't being synced to the database. This could be because:

1. **Webhook not configured in Clerk Dashboard**
2. **Webhook secret environment variable missing/incorrect**
3. **Clerk webhook events not subscribed**

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Verify Railway Environment Variables

Check that these environment variables are set in Railway:

```bash
# Required for webhook
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Also verify these exist
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

**How to check:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Select your project: `omni-write-production`
3. Click on "Variables" tab
4. Verify `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` exists

If missing, get it from Step 2 below.

---

### Step 2: Configure Webhook in Clerk Dashboard

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard:**
   - Visit https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Select your application

2. **Navigate to Webhooks:**
   - Click "Webhooks" in left sidebar
   - Click "Add Endpoint" button

3. **Configure the Webhook:**
   ```
   Endpoint URL: https://omni-write-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/clerk
   Description: Sync users to Supabase database
   ```

4. **Subscribe to Events:**
   Select these events:
   - ‚úÖ `user.created`
   - ‚úÖ `user.updated`
   - ‚úÖ `user.deleted`

5. **Save and Get Secret:**
   - Click "Create"
   - Clerk will show you the **Signing Secret**
   - Copy it (starts with `whsec_`)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Add this to Railway as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

---

### Step 3: Add Webhook Secret to Railway

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Select `omni-write-production` project
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Click "New Variable"
5. Add:
   ```
   Name: CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (from Clerk Dashboard)
   ```
6. Railway will auto-redeploy

---

### Step 4: Test the Webhook

#### Option A: Using Clerk Dashboard Test Feature

1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click "Testing" tab
4. Click "Send Example" for `user.created`
5. Check the response - should be `200 OK`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Clerk's test events have incomplete data and will trigger an error (by design). See our webhook handler logs for details.

#### Option B: Create a Real Test User (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open your app:** https://omni-write.vercel.app
2. **Sign out** if you're signed in
3. **Create a new test account:**
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Use a disposable email (e.g., test123@mailinator.com)
   - Complete signup
4. **Verify database sync:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Open "Table Editor"
   - Select `User` table
   - You should see the new user!

---

### Step 5: Verify Database Sync

**Check Supabase:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Table Editor"
4. Select `User` table
5. Verify users exist with:
   - `clerkId` (starts with `user_`)
   - `email`
   - `name` (if provided)
   - `createdAt`
   - `updatedAt`

**Check Profile Page:**
1. Sign in to https://omni-write.vercel.app
2. Go to Profile page
3. "Database Profile" section should show:
   - Database ID
   - Clerk ID
   - Created/Updated timestamps
   - ‚úÖ Instead of error message

---

## Debugging

### Check Railway Logs

```bash
# If you have Railway CLI:
railway logs

# Or in Dashboard:
# Go to your service ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click latest deployment ‚Üí Logs
```

**Look for:**
```
üì• Webhook received - Headers: { svix_id, svix_timestamp }
‚úÖ Webhook signature verified
üì® Webhook event: user.created for user user_xxxxx
‚úÖ User created successfully: user_xxxxx
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Missing svix headers" in logs
**Cause:** Request not from Clerk, or Clerk webhook not configured
**Fix:** Complete Step 2 (Configure webhook in Clerk Dashboard)

#### 2. "Invalid signature" in logs
**Cause:** Wrong webhook secret
**Fix:**
- Get correct secret from Clerk Dashboard
- Update `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway
- Wait for redeploy

#### 3. "No email addresses provided" error
**Cause:** Using Clerk's "Send Example" test feature (incomplete data)
**Fix:** Use a real signup instead (Option B in Step 4)

#### 4. Database connection errors
**Cause:** DATABASE_URL incorrect
**Fix:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL in Railway
- Check Supabase database is running
- Ensure password is URL-encoded

## Test the Full Flow End-to-End

**Prerequisites:**
- Webhook configured in Clerk Dashboard ‚úÖ
- CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET added to Railway ‚úÖ
- Railway redeployed ‚úÖ

**Test Steps:**

1. **Sign out** from https://omni-write.vercel.app
2. **Create new account:**
   - Use unique email (e.g., webhooktest@mailinator.com)
   - Complete signup flow
3. **Immediately check Railway logs:**
   - Should see webhook event logs
   - Should see "User created successfully"
4. **Check Supabase:**
   - User table should have new row
   - clerkId should match your Clerk user ID
5. **Go to Profile page:**
   - Database Profile section should display your data
   - No error messages

**If this works:** üéâ WEBHOOK SYNC IS FIXED!
